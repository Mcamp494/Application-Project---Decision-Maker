Decision Maker application
The goal of this application if for the user to be able to input choices, which will then be put through a RNG#
the resulting choice will then take the users zipcode and use that to give directions by integrating google maps
The user will be able to add the resturant choices. From these choices the program will pick a random choice from the list
and if the User does not like that option then they can reject it by selecting
 'no' and the program will put out a new option.

Warnings in place for incorrect inputs as the program will only accept strings for the inputs.



For this if,else-if, else statements will be used and have to find way to integrate distance to destination.
 Will have to do a controller method for this. User can only see the options to input the options and to lable the
 option. After that the user will not see how it works until an ouput is genrated. with that then

For the secure building process I have chosen to implement input validation, output encoding, and
basic programming practices so far.

Potential classes: User, Resturant (Subclasses?(Fast food, Dine-in)), Location
